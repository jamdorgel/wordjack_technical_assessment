4. What may happen if Foo.find(info[:id]) is called multiple times concurrently with the following code?

    I believe that since the function is being run in batches of 3, 
    if Foo.find(info[:id]) is called multiple times concurrently, 
    it could result in duplicates; the subscriber may receive more than 1 of the same email.
