4. What may happen if Foo.find(info[:id]) is called multiple times concurrently with the following code?

    I believe that since the function is being run in batches of 3 and those batches are happening concurrently,
    if Foo.find(info[:id]) is called multiple times, it could result in duplicates; the subscriber may receive more
    than 1 of the same email.
