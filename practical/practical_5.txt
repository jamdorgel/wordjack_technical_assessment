Please see practical_5.pdf to view my example of how the current data structure can be improved.

    I created 2 separate tables, one for Humans and a second for Pets by dividing the attributes on the original table.
    Then I created a new column for Pets labelled HUMAN_ID.
    This way by adding an ID for the separate categories, 
    you can still tell them apart while connecting the Pets to their Humans.
